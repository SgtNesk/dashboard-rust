# dashboard-rust
a test of rust language
the objective is to create a comfort space where i can manage and render fluid my path of studies on the net
what is intended with that is, i could even have a bookmark or else, but i'm a researcher in semplification, 
sometimes semplification could not mean the best solution, but no research, no discover.
so i'll try to have all in one place, timer, link to courses onClick, dashboard that render data like hours spent on courses and wich one,and the week program of studies.
if you are able to implement features and you have some ideas, you are welcome to contribute.

have a good day!
